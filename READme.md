1. Each sensor has its own configuration and dashboard page
2. Pages should be on the ESP32
3. When a user connects to a smart object, it should be able to read its values
4. Tables in database should be normalized. Suggested that we can have two tables.. one for sensor, one for smart object (smart object name and its location, its values)
5. The web dashboard basically displays all info of all sensors retrieved from DB
